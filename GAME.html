                            <h3>GAME</h3>
    <P>The first GAME store opened in Durban, South Africa, in 1970. It was born out of the belief by its founders that shopping had become a tedious and boring pastime. They wanted to create a fun shopping environment and so conceptualized retailing as a game. The signature shocking pink has still prevailed to this day.</P>
